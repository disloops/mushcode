@set here=UNFINDABLE
@set here=NO_COMMAND

&DESCRIBE here=Late at night, you awake with the sense that something outside requires your attention. A screened window carries the warm summer night to you and it feels alive with activity. As if in a dream, the mere thought of being outside seems to place you there. Something both strange and familiar beckons you onward.

&FAILURE Outside (o)=Before leaving, take a moment to set a couple of your attributes:%r%r1) Description - This is what someone sees when they "look" at you.%rUse [ansi(h,@desc me=<description>)] to set it and [ansi(h,look me)] to see how it looks.%r%r2) Sex - Your sex \[Male/Female\]%rUse [ansi(h,@sex me=<Male/Female>)] to set
it.%r%r3) Enter Flag - Setting "ENTER_OK" on yourself allows players to give you things.%rUse [ansi(h,@set me=ENTER_OK)] to set this flag.%r%r4) Basic lock - This prevents people from using "take" on you.%rUse [ansi(h,@lock me==me)] to set this. (Note: The double equal sign is necessary, it means that you have to "be you" to do
it.)
