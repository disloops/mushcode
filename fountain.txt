&DESCRIBE Fountain=The fountain is a wide, shallow oval. There is a steady trickle of water that falls into a series of basins and eventually drips into the pool below. The fountain is a shade of green that suggests tarnished copper and there are some small coins at the bottom of the pool.
&USE Fountain=You dip one hand into the fountain and are suprised at how cold the water is. It must spring from deep below.
&FAILURE Fountain=You can't take that.
&EFAIL Fountain=It's not really meant for swimming.
